Activity Summary
Reproducible Research Module 5 - Project 1

Introduction

Nowadays, it is possible to collect data of personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit or Nike Fuelband. These devices are helps enthusiasts to take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

Assignment

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day over 2-months period (i.e. October and November 2012).

str(activitydata)
## 'data.frame':    17568 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : chr  "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
The variables in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

Plot histgram of the total number of steps taken each day

Calculate the mean and median number of steps taken each day

## [1] 10395
Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

# Calculating the average number of steps taken, averaged across the days by 5-min intervals.

# Changing col names

Describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

# Filling in the missing values

Plot histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed (new dataset)
